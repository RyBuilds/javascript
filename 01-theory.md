#JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

**Simple:** JavaScript is a high-level, object-orientated, multi-paradigm programming language.

**Less Simple:** JavaScript is a `high-level` `prototype based object-oriented` `multi-paradigm` `interpreted or just-in-time compiled` `dynamic` `single-threaded` `garbage-collected` programming language with `first-class functions` and a non-blocking `event loop concurrency model`.

### High-Level

Every program needs hardware resources such as a memory and a CPU to do its work. Low-level languages (C) require you to manually manage these resources, for example asking the computer for memory to create a new variable. High-level languages (JS, Python) have abstractions which take all of that work away from us. This makes a language easier to learn and use, although programs will never be as fast or optimised as those written in C. One powerful tool which takes memory management away from us is `Garbage Collection`.
